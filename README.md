# face_recognition

The problem is that now a days when we authorize to a system online then it just take username, email or password to authorize, but it doesn't confirm that the person himself is there. So I have thought that if I can add face recognition then it can enhance the authentication security problem.

So aim of this project is to develop a authentication system that can enhance the security process by adding face recognition process at the time of logging in to the system. This can be used by any corporate company, professional sites or internet banking. 

Technology I have used :
Front - End : HTML, CSS
Backend : Flask 
Made model by : CV2
